# grafana-sqldb-datasource

SQL DB database is the datasource of Grafana 3.0, which provides the support of both of MySQL and PostgreSQL as a backend database.

## Features

### 1. Query Editor

Forked from influxDB plugin, this datasource frontend has been implemented. Therefore, you can issue SQL queries in the same manner as in influxDB.

(Defining with query editor)<br>
![Query Editor](https://github.com/sraoss/grafana-sqldb-datasource/wiki/images/query-editor.png)

Each parts (schema, table, column name and data type) refer to information_schema in RDB.

### 2. Text Editor Mode (support raw SQL)

You can switch to raw query mode by clicking icon.

(Toggling edit mode)<br>

Raw queries are generated refering to inputs of query editor. You can modify them (add JOIN another tables, sub queries in WHERE clause, and so on).

#### Macros

If you tries to mpdify a raw query or define it by yourself without choosing parts in query editor, you can use these macros.

| macro | detail |
|:------|:-------|
| $timeColumn | This is replaced to "TIME" from [TIME : TYPE] in query editor. |
| $timeFilter | This is replaced to "<code>$timeColumn < $from AND $timeColumn > $to</code>". |
| $from | This is replaced to "from" word of the time range for panels, and this is casted as "TYPE" from [TIME : TYPE] in query editor. |
| $to   | This is replaced to "to" of the time range for panels, and this is casted as "TYPE" from [TIME : TYPE] in query editor.|
| $unixFrom | This is replaced to "from" of the time range for panels, and this is casted as number of unix timestamp. |
| $unixTo   | This is replaced to "to" of the time range for panels, and this is casted as number of unix timestamp. |
| $timeFrom | This is replaced to "from" of the time range for panels, and this is casted as timestamp. |
| $timeTo   | This is replaced to "to" of the time range for panels, and this is casted as timestamp. |

### 3. Templating

You can create a template variable in Grafana and have that variable filled with values from any SQL Database metric exploration query. Then, You can use this variable in your SQL Database metric queries.

### 4. Annotations

Annotaions is also supported. You can issue SQL queries and add event information above graphes.ã€€

### 5. Using timestamp and unixtimestamp as a time-serise column

You can choose a time-serise column from the table definition.

(Choosing the column for time series)<br>

#### Data types

The supported data types for time-serise are:

| category | PostgreSQL | MySQL |
|:---------|:-----------|:-------|
| timestamp type | timestamp without time zone <br> timestamp with time zone | timestamp <br> datetime |
| number type <br> (if you use unixtimesamp as a time-serise column) | bigint <br> integer (int) <br> float <br> real <br> double precision <br> decimal <br> numeric | bigint <br> integer (int) <br> float <br> real <br> double precision <br> decimal <br> numeric |

## Example
### Query with variables
```
SELECT $unixtimeColumn * 1000 AS time_msec,
       avg(cpu_usr)
       FROM myschema.dstat
       WHERE tag ~* '/^$host_t$/' AND
             $timeFilter
GROUP BY $unixtimeColumn
ORDER BY $unixtimeColumn
```

### Actual query in PostgreSQL
#### timestamp type
```
SELECT round(extract(epoch from coltime::timestamptz) / 1200) * 1200 * 1000 AS time_msec,
       avg(cpu_usr)
       FROM myschema.dstat
       WHERE tag ~* '/^webserver123$/' AND
coltime > (now() - '7d'::interval)
GROUP BY round(extract(epoch from coltime::timestamptz) / 1200) * 1200
ORDER BY round(extract(epoch from coltime::timestamptz) / 1200) * 1200
```

#### number type
```
SELECT round(coltime / 1200) * 1200 * 1000 AS time_msec,
       avg(cpu_usr)
       FROM myschema.dstat
       WHERE tag ~* '/^webserver123$/' AND
coltime > extract(epoch from (now() - '7d'::interval)::timestamptz)
GROUP BY round(coltime / 1200) * 1200
ORDER BY round(coltime / 1200) * 1200
```

### Actual query in MySQL
#### timestamp type
```
SELECT (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(coltime) DIV 1200) * 1200 * 1000 AS time_msec,
       avg(cpu_usr)
       FROM myschema.dstat
       WHERE tag REGEXP '^webserver123$' AND
             coltime > DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
             GROUP BY (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(coltime) DIV 1200) * 1200
             ORDER BY (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(coltime) DIV 1200) * 1200;
```

#### number type
```
SELECT (coltime DIV 1200) * 1200 * 1000 AS time_msec,
       avg(cpu_usr)
       FROM myschema.dstat
       WHERE tag REGEXP '^webserver123$' AND
coltime > UNIX_TIMESTAMP(DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY))
GROUP BY (coltime DIV 1200) * 1200
ORDER BY (coltime DIV 1200) * 1200
```
